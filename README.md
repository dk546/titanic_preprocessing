# Titanic Preprocessing & Random Forest Project

This project is focused on exploring data preprocessing techniques using the Titanic dataset from OpenML (ID: 40945). The final goal is to build a classification model using Random Forests.

## Phases
1. Data Understanding
2. Preprocessing (Imputation, Encoding, Scaling, etc.)
3. Model Building with Random Forest
4. Evaluation & Reflection

## Dataset Source
OpenML - [Titanic Dataset (ID: 40945)](https://www.openml.org/d/40945)
